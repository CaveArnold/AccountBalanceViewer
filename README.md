This is a Windows Forms application designed to make updating My Retirement Tracking Spreadsheet simple by aggregating by taxable type and including the normalization factor in a preformed calculation that can be pasted directly into one of the tax type columns shown by the application.

- All the required database schema objects can be created using the DDL kept in this GitHub repository: [Guyton-Klinger-Withdrawals](https://github.com/CaveArnold/Guyton-Klinger-Withdrawals)
